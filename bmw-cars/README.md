## :wrench: Project Setup.
# HTML:

The structure includes a dropdown menu for selecting BMW car models, a button to show details, and a div to display the selected car's details.

# CSS:

Basic styling is applied to center the content, style the dropdown and button, and give a clean look to the website.

# JavaScript:

An object carDetails holds information about each BMW model.

An event listener is added to the button. When clicked, it retrieves the selected car model from the dropdown and displays the corresponding details in the carDetails div.
